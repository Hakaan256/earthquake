Knowledge -> Derivations

- "A was hit at 12:00"
- - quake occurred
- - distance proportional to time
- - "quake occurred"
- - - SAT gradient (everywhere)

- "A was hit at 12:00 AND at 1:00"
- - quake occurred
- - distance proportional to time
- - given S&P, d&t can be derived
- - "quake occurred n meters away from A"
- - - SAT ring

- "A was hit at 12:00, B was hit at 1:00"
- - quake occurred
- - diff in distance proportional to diff in time
- - "quake occurred n meters further from B than A"
- - - SAT line

- "A was hit at 12:00, B was hit at 1:00, and Quake started at 11:00"
- - quake occurred
- - distance proportional to time
- - "quake occurred n meters away from A, and m meters away from B"
- - - SAT 2 pts

- "A was hit at 12:00, B was hit at 1:00, C was hit at 2:00"
- - quake occurred
- - diffs in distance proportional to diffs in time
- - "quake occurred n meters further from B than A, and m meters further from C than B"
- - - SAT 1 pt

Levels

- 1 Location. E @ T = 0; Try to find as many SAT locs. Direct towards spattering attempts. Hopefully reveal circle.
- 1 Location. E @ T = ?; Try to find as many SAT time/locs. Hopefully reveal "expanding circle"
- 1 Location. E @ T = 0; S&P. Try to find as many SAT locs. Notice circle, and that SAT'ing S also SAT's P.
- 1 Location. E @ T = ?; S&P. Try to find as many SAT time/locs. Notice circle, but also notice that can only satisfy both from certain T!
- 2 Locations. E @ T = 0; Try to find as many SAT locs, for each location individually. Notice two circles. What SAT's both circles?
