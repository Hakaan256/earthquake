- Level progression:

- increase in given information

- "A was hit at 12:00"
- - quake occurred
- - distance proportional to time
- - - SAT gradient (everywhere)
- - - - can play with "satisfying" that info in multiple ways
- - - - - given quake started at t = 11:00, can place quake at any spot around radius
- - - - - if _not_ given quake starting t, you can place quake anywhere, given it is also placed at corresponding time (complex UI?)

- "A was hit at 12:00 AND at 1:00"
- - quake occurred
- - distance proportional to time
- - given S&P, d&t can be derived
- - - SAT ring

- "A was hit at 12:00, B was hit at 1:00"
- - quake occurred
- - - not knowing time, you can reduce SAT locations to a line
