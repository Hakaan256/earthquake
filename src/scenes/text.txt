"What can we know about earthquakes? And how can we know it?",

];
[
"Did you see how a wave moved out from the earthquake's <b>epicenter</b> and expanded until it hit the city?",
"We can see <b>where</b> the earthquake started,",
"we can see <b>when</b> it started,",
"and we can see <b>when</b> it was <b>experienced</b> by Square City.",
"But with real earthquakes, we have to <b>construct</b> all of that information from a <b>limited amount of data</b>.",

];
[
"The real information we have looks something more like this.",

"How can we figure out <b>when</b> an earthquake </b>originated</b> from only <b>when</b> it was <b>felt</b>?",
"Before we can answer, we have to quickly learn <b>just a bit more</b> about earthquakes.",
"Earthquakes send <b>multiple</b> shockwaves <b>from their epicenter</b>.",
"Each travels at a <b>different speed</b>- The <b>P-wave</b> (or Primary Wave) is much faster than the <b>S-Wave</b> (or Secondary Wave)",
"Let's see what that might look like.",
];
[
"See how the <b>P-Wave</b> (purple) travels at <b>twice the speed</b> of the <b>S-Wave</b> (blue)?",
"Look at <b>when</b> each wave was <b>reported</b> (shown on the timeline).",
"How can we use this to help determine <b>when</b> the earthquake <b>originated</b>?",
];
[
"Let's show that same earthquake, but this time, with <b>two locations</b>.",
"One will feel the tremors <b>shortly after</b> the quake originates,",
"And one will feel the tremors <b>long after</b> the quake has originated.",
"See how each experiences the shockwaves <b>differently</b> (watch the timeline!).",
];
[
"Do you see the <b>difference</b>?",
"Circle City feels the tremors <b>one soon after the other</b>, and Square City feels them <b>longer apart</b>.",
"We can use <b>how far apart</b> the <b>S-Wave</b> and the <b>P-Wave</b> were experienced to determine <b>how long ago</b> the quake <b>originated</b>.",
];
[
"<b>Without both</b> the S and P Waves, <b>we can't figure out when the quake originated</b>.",
"Was it <b>very close</b> and <b>very recent</b>? Or was it <b>very far away</b> and <b>very long ago</b>?",
"Here's an example of a <b>far away</b> quake that started <b>long ago</b>, hitting Square City-",
];
[
"Let's see if there could have been another scenario that <b>doesn't conflict with what we know</b> (exactly <b>when</b> Square City was hit).",
"Slide the <b>Quake Origin</b> on the timeline to start the quake <b>closer to when</b> Square City felt its tremors.",
];
[
"The quake could have been <b>very close</b> and <b>very recent</b>, and it <b>still</b> would have hit Square City <b>at the reported time</b>!",
"That means <b>we can't know</b> which scenario was true <b>with only this information</b>.",
];
[
"Let's see that <b>same scenario</b>, but this time, with <b>both S and P waves</b>.",
"Move the <b>origin time</b> until <b>both</b> the S wave <b>and</b> the P wave <b>hit Square City at the reported times</b>.",
];
[
"See how with reports of <b>both</b> the time of experiencing the <b>P Wave</b>, <b>and</b> the time of experiencing the <b>S Wave</b>, we can <b>narrow down</b> the <b>origin time</b> to a single possibility!",
"Once we've achieved that, we're <b>one step closer</b> to discovering <b>where</b> the earthquake originated.",
];
[
"Another earthquake has hit <b>Square City</b>!",
"To figure out <b>where</b> the earthquake originated (or \"to find its <b>epicenter</b>\"),",
"we're going to assume we already know <b>when</b> it originated.",
"(This means we'll no longer need to visualize both the <b>P-Waves</b> <i>and</i> the <b>S-Waves</b> going forward.)",
"Only knowing <b>when</b> the earthquake started, and <b>when</b> it hit Square City,",
"place a guess <b>where</b> you think the earthquake might have occurred!",
];
[
"It looks like the earthquake <b>could not have</b> originated at that location.",
"If it had, Square City would have reported <b>experiencing its tremors</b> at a <b>different time</b>.",
"Keep guessing until we find a location that <b>doesn't conflict</b> with any of the information we know.",
];
[
"Wow! Good guess!",
"The timing of that guessed epicenter <b>does not conflict</b> with the information we know.",
"While we <b>can't yet</b> difinitively say \"that is the earthquake's epicenter\", we <b>can't rule it out</b>-",

"Great work!",
"So you've found a couple locations that <b>cannot be ruled out</b> as epicenters-",
"that is, we've made some guesses that <b>don't conflict with what we know</b>.",
"Make a few more guesses, and try to look for a pattern. <b>What does the space look like</b> where the quake might have originated?",
"(Don't be afraid to make guesses all over the map!)",
];
[
"Do you see the pattern starting to emerge?",
"Because <b>we know when the earthquake originated</b>, and <b>when Square City felt its tremors</b>,",
"we can <b>rule out some locations as possible epicenters</b>, and <b>cannot rule out</b> others.",
"Keep guessing until the pattern is obvious.",
];
[
"So you think you see the pattern?",
"Click and drag out from Square City to highlight the area that <b>cannot be ruled out</b> as a possible epicenter of the earthquake",
];
[
"The pattern is a ring!",
"From only the information of <b>when</b> a quake originated, <b>when</b> a quake was felt (at a known location), and <b>how fast</b> a quake travels,",
"we can <b>narrow down</b> possible <b>epicenters</b> to a <b>ring</b> around the <b>known location</b>.",
"The <b>radius</b> of the ring is <b>proportional</b> to the <b>difference in time between when it originated, and when it was felt</b>.",
"In other words, <b>the longer it takes to travel, the larger the circle.</b>",
"From now on, you'll be able to <b>drag out these rings</b> from locations.",
];
[
"So, now that we have the ability to <b>drag a ring out from locations</b> to illuminate locations that <b>don't conflict with our known information</b>,",
"we'll now reduce the <b>error range</b>.",
"That is, for us to consider a location <b>plausibly correct</b>, it will have to be <b>very precise</b>.",
"With this new tool, and new restriction, try to find 3 <b>plausible epicenters</b> that <b>don't conflict with our known information.",
];
[
"Cool. So we know how to pretty effectively narrow down <b>possible epicenters</b> to a ring",
"from only the information of <b>when</b> a quake originated, <b>when</b> a quake was felt (at a known location), and <b>how fast</b> a quake travels.",
"But how could we narrow it down further? We want to find <b>exactly where the quake originated</b>.",
"Unfortunately, <b>a ring</b> is the best we can narrow the possibilities down with <b>only that information</b>.",
"But what if we had more information?",
"What if there was <b>another location</b>, and we knew <b>when it felt the tremor</b> as well?",
];
[
"Well good news!",
"Circle city just called in when <b>they felt the earthquake's tremors</b>.",
"Using that information, see if you can narrow the possible locations that <b>don't conflict with any known information</b> down further!",
"Find 2 plausible <b>epicenters</b>.",
];
[
"Ok. So we've narrowed it down even more!",
"With one location, we can <b>reduce the possible epicenter</b> to a <b>ring</b>.",
"With two locations, we get <b>two rings</b>.",
"But the epicenter <b>has to fall on both rings</b>.",
"This leaves at most <b>two small areas</b> where the rings intersect as <b>the only possible epicenters</b>.",
"That's a big reduction!",
"But we still don't yet know <b>exactly</b> where the quake's epicenter is located...",
"Which of the <b>two possible areas</b> is it?",
"We can answer this question by adding <b>one more location</b>...",
];
[
"So now we've got 3 locations.",
"See if you can find the <b>exact</b> epicenter!",
];
[
"Ok! Now you know how to <b>triangulate</b> the epictner of an earthquake!",
];
[
"Triangulation has applications beyond <b>finding the epicenter of earthquakes</b>.",
"It's also used by <b>Global Positioning Systems</b> (or <b>GPS</b>)!",
"A key difference is that, rather than a wave <b>emitting from the unknown location</b>, towards a set of <b>known locations</b>,",
"waves instead <b>are emitted from known locations</b>, toward an <b>unknown location</b>.",
"Click Play to see what this might look like",
];
[
"See how each <b>Satellite</b> emits a wave <b>toward</b> the GPS device?",
"Whenever the device <b>receives a signal</b> from any of the <b>known locations</b>, it marks down <b>how far away</b> it is from <b>the location sending the signal</b>.",
"Just like with earthquakes- when you have a <b>known distance</b> to a <b>known location</b>, you have reduced your <b>possible position</b> to <b>a ring</b>.",
"<b>3 distances</b> from <b>3 locations</b> means <b>3 rings</b>, which is enough to find <b>exactly where you are</b>!",
];
[
"Time to <b>test your intuition</b>!",
"Only showing <b>when each location was hit</b>, <b>guess</b> where you think the earthquake <b>originated</b>.",
"You <b>won't be able</b> to <b>drag out circles</b> from the locations until you guess!",
];
[
"This area allows you to play around with <b>random</b> configurations of locations and quakes.",
"See if you can figure anything out about <b>what positioning of locations</b> works best, and what doesn't.",
"You'll be able to play as many different <b>random scenarios</b> as you'd like-",
"Good luck!",
