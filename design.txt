Considerations:
- UI ought be usable via touch devices
  - Can't make use of hover
  - Need big, touchable buttons (or gestures)
- Game might be played in iframe
  - Shouldn't treat game as full browser web page- isolated rectangle more naturally iframe-able
- Variable interactivity throughout game
  - Many screens only allow "play" to be clicked
  - Multiple different combinations of "what interactions are allowed"
- Variable visualization throughout game
  - Some levels/visualizations can be big and explicit based on there only being one earthquake or one location
  - Others, with dynamic # earthquakes, dynamic # quakes selected, > 1 location, etc... need to vary viz by interaction so to not get crowded
